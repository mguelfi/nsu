        ==================
        
        ---
        
        nessusScanUploader is a python module to pull new scan results from a Nessus 
        Manager instance and send them to an Azure storage instance (blob or file),
        or an AWS api-gateway.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Recommended to be installed as an unprivileged user on your Nessus Manager host
        or another host that has access to its API.
        
        ```bash
        python3 -m pip install --user nessusScanUpload-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Configuration file defaults to ~/nessusScanUpload.conf
        and will also look for these files on Linux:
        - /etc/nessusScanUpload.conf
        - ~/.nessusScanUpload
        
        or Windows:
        - nessusScanUpload.ini
        - %APPDATA%/nessusScanUpload.ini
        
        **An example configuration file:**
        ```
        [nessus]
        # Access key for an account that can read scan results
        accessKey = wnimhx040msap14c5sk0ick5drtct5f2jdwpf90dkqguvqdzhhsvxku51zgwecxh
        secretKey = zxx19f0126ta40c64t3qw4tr990uq67fv8gdcbi7s2hwtlfrnitfhb5oqugy1sjo
        # host can be ip or name
        host = nessushostname.org
        port = 8834
        ssl_verify = False
        scheme = https
        
        [azure]
        connection_string =
        # Can be a blob container or a file share folder, not both.
        container =
        folder = foldername
        
        [aws]
        url = https://b0cfrixog2.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/prod
        api_key = <as advised>
        repo = <as advised>
        ssl_verify = False
        
        [savefile]
        path=~/nessusScanUpload.save
        ```
