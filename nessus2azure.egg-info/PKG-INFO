Description: # nessus2azure
        
        nessus2azure is a python module to pull new scan results from a Nessus Manager
        instance and send them to an Azure storage instance (blob or file).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Recommended to be installed as an unprivileged user on your Nessus Manager host
        or another host that has access to its API.
        
        ```bash
        python3 -m pip install --user nessus2azure-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Configuration file defaults to ~/nessus2azure.conf
        and will also look for these files on Linux:
        - /etc/nessus2azure.conf
        - ~/.nessus2azure
        
        or Windows:
        - nessus2azure.ini
        - %APPDATA%/nessus2azure.ini
        
        **An example configuration file:**
        ```
        [nessus]
        # Access key for an account that can read scan results
        accessKey = wnimhx040msap14c5sk0ick5drtct5f2jdwpf90dkqguvqdzhhsvxku51zgwecxh
        secretKey = zxx19f0126ta40c64t3qw4tr990uq67fv8gdcbi7s2hwtlfrnitfhb5oqugy1sjo
        # host can be ip or name
        host = nessushostname.org
        port = 8834
        ssl_verify = False
        scheme = https
        
        [azure]
        connection_string =
        # Can be a blob container or a file share folder, not both.
        #container = containername
        folder = foldername
        
        [savefile]
        path=~/nessus2azure.save
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        python3 -m nessus2azure
        
        ## Logging
